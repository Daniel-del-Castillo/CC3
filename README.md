# CC3
## Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa
This repository contains an implementation of the power function as a primitive recursive function. It was made for the Computational Complexity subject at ULL.

# Compiling
The code is in C++ and you can compile it yourself or use the makefile prepared for that matter.
```sh
make
```

# Use
The program will ask you for two numbers and then will output the result. This by itself isn't remarkable at all, but the code tries to mimic primitive recursive functions, which is what makes it special.
